The Annual Austin Diversity Hackathon - #ATXDivHack - is coming back for the 5th time in September 20~22, 2019! If you are still wondering if you should come -- you totally should! And here are the reasons.


I love #ATXDivHack so much. I've "hacked" for the last 3 years, and am the organizer this year. #ATXDIVHACK is a beginner friendly, inclusive, and fun event. The goal is for all participants to:
* Learn something new
* Make friends and connections
* Have fun!

#### Learn something new
It's easy to see that one can learn something new technically - a new technology, library, framework, etc. With only 2 days to finish and very helpful mentors, this can be a great crush course of your own choice!

There are even more non-technical skills to gain! Project management, feature definition, how to work in a team, manage a team, coach a team...If you are self-taught and have been working alone, this is a good time to practice these skills.

#### Make friends and connections
People come here to collaborate. I'm not very social, but it's very easy to start a conversation: start by asking what they are making/want to make!

I have met so many cool people, some I become good friends with, some become mentors. I have also gotten interview opportunities.

#### Have fun!
I mean, why would you spend your weekend on something that's not fun?
