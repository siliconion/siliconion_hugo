# Vocab definition
* CPU core: a core includes a physical component that do shit
* CPU thread: CPU can use both the rising and falling edge to trigger registers. This is called hyper-threading. Effectively, one single physical CPU can be used as two logical CPU. This, in CPU spec, is called CPU threads. **This is different than threading in operational systems.**
* thread: if it's not specifically specified, a thread refers to an OS thread. 
* process

# Why threading 

# How 

# concurrency vs parallelism
concurrency (OS): the ability of a system to run 2 or more programs at the same time.
Dealing a lot of things at once, about structure

Parallelism: tasks are broken into sub-parts, and multiple CPU/cores process each sub-task at the same time.
Doing a lot of things at once, about execution
